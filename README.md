# Attendance-Tracker

**Attendance Tracker** is my personal project developed to manage and track my attendance for various subjects in a simple and efficient manner. It is a simple Java-based command-line application to keep track of class attendance across multiple subjects. It allows me to log attendance for each weekday, add extra classes if necessary, and view a summarized report of the attendance percentages.

### Features:
- **Track Attendance**: Allows to input and track attendance for different subjects on a daily basis.
- **Extra Sessions**: Provides the option to record attendance for additional sessions that may not be part of the regular schedule.
- **Attendance Summary**: Generates a summary showing the number of classes attended and the attendance percentage for each subject.

### Purpose:
This project was developed as part of my learning journey to improve my skills in Java programming and to build a useful tool for personal or educational use. It helps track attendance in a simple, text-based format and provides insight into my attendance trends for multiple subjects.
